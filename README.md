## 🧠 Overview

**Libft** is the foundational project at **42 Network**, designed to help students master the basics of the **C programming language** and strengthen understanding of memory management, string manipulation, and linked lists.  

In this project, the goal is to **recreate a custom version of the C standard library** (`libc`), implementing essential functions such as those for:
- Character and string handling  
- Memory allocation and manipulation  
- Linked list operations  
- Basic utilities for general C programming  

By the end of this project, you’ll have your **own reusable library** to use in all future 42 projects.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

- Reimplement a variety of standard C functions  
- Understand pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory  
- Create a modular and maintainable library  
- Follow the **42 Norminette** coding style strictly
